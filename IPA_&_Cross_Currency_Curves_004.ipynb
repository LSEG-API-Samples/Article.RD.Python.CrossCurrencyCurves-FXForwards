    "Instrument Pricing Analytics (IPA) is a powerful service provided by LSEG through the Refinitiv Data Platform REST API (more interestingly for us, the [Refinitiv Data Library for Python](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-library-for-python) (RD)) that provides calculators for financial operations ranging from [Bond Contracts](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis/documentation#ipa-financial-contracts-bond-contracts) to [Exchange Traded Instrument (ETI) Volatility Surfaces](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis/documentation#ipa-financial-contracts-bond-contracts) and everything inbetween. The functionality we're after in this article is [FX Cross Contracts](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis/documentation#ipa-financial-contracts-fx-cross-contracts). Thanks to this service, we can recreate any calculation found in the FWDS app:\n",

    "### Forwards\n",
    "\n",
    "Forwards are simple contracts at heart: it's a contract buying one currency for another in the future at an agreed rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "One buys a Forward Contract (also known as (a.k.a.): a Forward) to purchase something (*exempli gratia* (e.g.): a currency such as Great British Pounds (GBP)), at a certain price (e.g.: in Euros (EUR)), at a certain date in the future (e.g.: in 1 year's time). It is said that someone is \"long FX forward position\" when they're exposed to fluctuations in a specific currency through an FX forward contract, e.g.: I am in a long EUR/GBP FX forward position when I bought a forward contract tying me into the purchase of GBP (e.g.: 860GBP) in exchange for sale of EUR (e.g.: 1000EUR) at a rate prescribed by the forward contract ($F_{0,f/d}$, e.g.: 8.60GBP)."

    "#### Nomeclature: \"Base\" and \"Quote\" Currencies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, unfortunutally, conventions in FX that complicate things, mainly related to the [\"Base Currency\" (a.k.a.: \"Transaction Currency\")](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basecurrency.asp) and the [\"Quote Currency\"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quotecurrency.asp). Thankfully, there are a few rules that one may follow to make sense of it all:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Base Currency is always 1. E.g.: You can get 0.07538 CAD (Canadian Dolars) for each MXN (Mexical Pessos), here MXN is the Base Currency, and the CAD is the Quote Currency.\n",
    "2. The currency closest to the rate is the Quote Currency, and the currency furthest from the rate is the Base Currency. E.g.: \"CHFMAD 11.4930\" means that the MAD (Moroccan Dirham) is the Quote Currency, and the CHF (Swiss Franc) is Base Currency and you can get 11.4930 MAD per 1 CHF.\n",
    "3. When an FX rate is quoted without the rate (e.g.: in a calculator), the rate is always assumed to come afterwards. E.g.1: if \"ZARFJD\" is 0.1177, it represents \"ZARFJD 0.1177\"; here FJD (Fijian Dollar) is the Quote Currency, and ZAR (South African Rand) is the Base Currency; you can get 0.1177 FJD for every 1 ZAR. E.g.2: if \"NOKRON=\" is 0.4189, it represents \"NOKRON=0.4189\"; NOK (Norwegian Krone) is the Base Currency, RON (Romanian Leu) the Quote Currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can get any syymbols in the midle of your numonic; e.g.1: \"KRW/PKR=2.0764\" means that KRW (South Korean Won) is the Base Currency, PKR (Pakistani Rupee) is the Quote Currency, and you can get 2.0764PKR for every 1KRW; e.g.2: for \"53.83 MGA/INR\", MGA (Malagasy Ariary) is the Quote Currency and INR (Indian Rupee) is the Base Currency, and you can get 53.83 MGA per 1 INR."

    "#### \"Straight\" Forwards vs Forwards\n",
    "\n",
    "1st, let's look at \"Straight\" Forwards, i.e.: Forwards for two currencies, with none 'in the middle'; the 'middle currency' usually is the USD, and we'll look at them later. You can find the meaning behind any one item in the FWDS add by hovering over it, so I will not explain every item here. Rather, I will use the labels to refer to the buttons and values:\n",

    "In the screenshot above, we\n",
    "\n",
    "(I) picked EURGBP in $\\textcolor{red}{a}$ (for the app to compute values for the Euro/Great British Pound currency pair) such that EUR is the Base Currency, and GBP is the Quote Currency;\n",
    "\n",
    "(II) made sure we were calculating values relating to forward contracts for EUR & GBP with $\\textcolor{red}{b}$ &  $\\textcolor{red}{c}$, as opposed to 'Rates' (i.e.: Deposit Rates) (more on this later),\n",
    "\n",
    "(III) picked a Trade Date in $\\textcolor{red}{d}$ (a date in the past can be chosen to simulate past trades) and the calculator automatically picked a [Value Date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuedate.asp#:~:text=Value%20Date%20in%20Trading&text=Due%20to%20differences%20in%20time,agree%20to%20the%20exchange%20rate.) in $\\textcolor{red}{e}$ (the date that the the currencies are handed over from buyer to seller; due to differences in time zones and bank processing delays, the value date for spot trades in foreign currencies is usually set two days after a transaction is agreed on, often depicted as \"T+2\"),\n",
    "\n",
    "(IV) can glanced at the Bid (left) and Ask (right) [Spot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/forex-spot-rate.asp) rates for the FX pair we have in mind with $\\textcolor{red}{f}$. Here the Bid Spot Rate is 0.8633, the Ask Spot Rate is 0.8637;\n",
    "\n",
    "(V) glanced at the market data that calculations were made with via $\\textcolor{red}{g}$\n",
    "\n",
    "(VI) picked a reference rate of EUR with $\\textcolor{red}{g}$, so that we only see the straight pair (only EUR and GBP with no intermediaries; an intermediary could be USD, for e.g., whereby someone would exchange EUR for USD and USD for GBP if there was noone selling GBP for EUR, but there was someone ready to sell USD for EUR, and someone else to sell GBP for USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've done this, we can see the calculated results under \"Standard Periods\" (to the left of $\\textcolor{red}{t}$). What are we looking at exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "(V) In column $\\textcolor{red}{u}$, we can see the Forward's period we're after. the last row shows the \"2Y\" period, i.e.: data about Farwards with a 2 year maturity. Explicit dates related to this maturity can be seen in column $\\textcolor{red}{w}$; that last row shows data for Forwards written on Oct 16th 2023 (the day I took the screenshot) and ending 2 years later (Oct 16th 2025), that's to say 731 days later, as shown in column column $\\textcolor{red}{x}$. If the maturity date falls on a weekend, a yellow $\\textcolor{yellow}{W}$ will show up in column $\\textcolor{blue}{v}$; if it falls on a local holiday, it will be a red $\\textcolor{red}{H}$; the next working day becomes the defacto maturity date.\n",
